# PLAYPOST

Playing with Go and Gin. This is a simple social media backend code allowing to create a post, commenting and reacting to it. REST API is the main way to interact with it. Still in development (not a heavy one tho).

## How to Run (Note to me, don't follow)

install `air` by running this
```
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
```

If you are cool and already set GO_HOME and GO_ROOT environment variables, just run:
```
air
```
to run the app and continue the development.
